## Always be cheating

we live by this phrase, it is our goals in life, business, and what we present to you. We belive that in this market, if you look at the biggest companies out there. They just cheat and then apologize for it later. As a 100% privately held company with no investors, no loans and full asset control we do the same thing, though we can pass the benefits on to you, the consumers, rather than having to cut costs to make money for investors or stake holders.

## Winning is just the beginning

We like winning, but winning is just the beginning. Our end goal is to shift the economey to a consumer centric, anti consumerism market that is sustainable, safe and able to account for the mass amount of people we want to serve.

## Politics

in our opinion politics are like jerk sessions. While we avoid politics internally, we acknowledge the need to address our incumbent desire to be politically incorrect. We believe that Political Correctness and Professionalism are both socially acceptable forms of self censorship and we believe that we live in a society where growth is only possible when honesty and integrity are valued over the feelings and emotions of the emotionally immature.
