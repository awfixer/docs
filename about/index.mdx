## Always be cheating

we live by this phrase, it is our goals in life, business, and what we present to you. We belive that in this market, if you look at the biggest companies out there. They just cheat and then apologize for it later. As a 100% privately held company with no investors, no loans and full asset control we do the same thing, though we can pass the benefits on to you, the consumers, rather than having to cut costs to make money for investors or stake holders.
