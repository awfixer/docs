## The Founders

The majority owners of AWFixer Holdings LLC are AWFixer and jinx, the original founders of the endeavor and current chairmen of the Board of Friends. They collectively own 95% of the AWFixer Holdings Company and Subsidiary Companies and ensure that the values of the company and its charter are abserved in every decision and venture that AWFixer Holding and it's subsidiaries decide to take on or pursue.

## The Board of Friends

the Board of Friends is closely akin to a Board of Directors though we take a slightly more nontraditional comradical approach to leadership here at AWFixer Holdings.

The Board of Friends is composed of 7 board members, Daixso, King, Nerds, Viper, Boeing, Nick, and Alasti with 2 permenate postions reserved for the founders AWFixer and jinx.

## The Board of Partners

we also are working on building a board of partner brands. These brands are brands that we consider aligned with our mission and provide a critcal service for us. In exchange for this critcal service they provide they get a seat on the Board of Friends. This board, while not a board that makes executive decisions at the Holding Company or any of our subsidaries is a voice we take seriously as we do not want to make business agnostic decisions that do damage to our partners or make bets on market changes without consulting with them and informing them of our goals and progress.

## Community Leadership Team(s)

We have 2 Community Leadership teams in the pipe at this time. One for the offical AWFixer and Friends Community and one for the AWFixer's Lounge Community. These teams run the weekly community syncs and bring meeting notes to our weekly board meeting to inform the boards of the interests, potentials and volitality of our community base. We place an above average value on the community, as we are here to serve you and our community focus is a large part of the AWFixer Holdings Charter.

## Meetings

the Board of Friends and Board of Partners meet at the same time, once a week where we review work being done on the projects, products, consider ventures and review our capital expendatures. These meetings are only recorded one time per quarter where we host the meeting in public for anyone with a stake or interest in our business to attend.

we host 2 weekly community syncs. One in the AWFixer and Friends offical community and one in the AWFixer's Lounge Community where we give time to our commumity and provide a way for them to provide input in the work we are doing and what they would like to see, and would like to not see, moving forward.
