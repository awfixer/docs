## Current Income Plans

we will be working off of sponsorships, donations, and partnerships for the near future as we do not plan on taking on any VC or Angle funding. Our current goals are to remain completely independant and develop the best products for our users.

We will accept high value donations though we want to make it explicitly clear that we do not provide SAFEs or any other form of consideration for these donations and you are not promised or guarenteed anything in return for your donations.

if you want to donate then you can open a ticket on the [Discord](https://discord.awfixer.com) Server and we will provide you with a list of options for one time and reoccuring donations at this time.

if you want to make a high value donation (bigger than \$500 initial amount one time or reoccuring) it is suggested that you schedule a meeting with AWFixer using [this link](https://cal.com/awfixer)
