## AWFixer Account Services

AWFixer Account Services will be the single account that you use to access and manage all services owned, managed and controlled by AWFixer Holding LLC.

## AWFixerID

AWFixerID is our solution to insecurities in the Emails and SMS/RCS authentication methods. It is an application that we have designed from the ground up to provide passkey storage, TOTP storage, push notification MFA validation and ID verification for complex access cases. It will be a ciritcal part of our account verification phase and will be treated as such.
