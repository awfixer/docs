# What is FutureJS

<Info>
  FutureJS is in development right now, we will add more details to this as the development team makes changes to the plans
</Info>

FutureJS is not a framework, or a package manager or a runtime or a library. FutureJS is all of the above, and more. It is meant to be a full JS ecosystem designed to provide optimized hosting, builds, error tracking, analytics and more. with 0 external dependancies, 0 supply chain needs and the best performance on the market.

Currently the source code for FutureJS is not public and can only be accessed by our Developers and trusted contributors. We will release FutureJS under the AWFixer Source AI-Restricted License when we get to version 0.1.0.
