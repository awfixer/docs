## What is considered a Product Release?

any update or version change is considered a product release to us and will warrent a page on this site where we detailed what changes, who helped, why it changed and what it means for you, the end user.

<Info>
  we will release 3 points deep of releases here (aka 0.0.0) anything deeper then that will likely be a patched version and update notifications will be issued as announcements from our community teams and via our social channels
