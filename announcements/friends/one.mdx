## What is the Board of Friends?

We would like to take part of this announcement and use it to introduce what we are, define what we are and clarify our role in the world of AWFixer Holding and AWFixer Holding's Subsidary Companies.

We are essentially a board of directors, though because of the fact that AWFixer Holding and it's subsidaries are structured in lean, minimal leadership way we elected not to have a board of directors and instead adopt a more flexable and friendly way of deciding the running of our day to day businesses, and that is the Board of Friends.

Our day to day job is to observe an interact with our customers, partners, employees, contributors and maintainers with a hope of collecting valuable information about the climate and the market environment and then take the information and use it to make educated decisions about the direction of AWFixer Holdings.
