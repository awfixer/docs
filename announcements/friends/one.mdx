## What is the Board of Friends?

We would like to take part of this announcement and use it to introduce what we are, define what we are and clarify our role in the world of AWFixer Holding and AWFixer Holding's Subsidary Companies.

We are essentially a board of directors, though because of the fact that AWFixer Holding and it's subsidaries are structured in lean, minimal leadership way we elected not to have a board of directors and instead adopt a more flexable and friendly way of deciding the running of our day to day businesses, and that is the Board of Friends.
